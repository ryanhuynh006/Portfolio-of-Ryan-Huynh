            <h3>Hi, I'm Ryan Huynh!</h3>
            <p>I see you'd like to know a bit more about me. I wouldn't blame you!
                Well, to start, I joined this bootcamp because of my passion for the more technical world, and it 
                doesn't get more technical than programming! During the day, I am a full-time worker who is glued to 
                his laptop. At night, I am more or less the same! In my free time, I like to stay active by going to the gym,
                playing volleyball, or taking some walks in nature. I also love to cook, discover new TV/movies, and play games.
                Through this bootcamp, I hope to greatly enhance my knowledge and skills within the programming world!
